<p>Letter of Recommendation</p><p>      </p><p>My name is Cristina Olaru, and I am a first-degree teacher at “Tudor Vianu” National High School of Computer Science. The curriculum of our high school focuses on Computer Science, Mathematics and Sciences. The advanced rank of our institution it is justified by a large number of prizes won by our students in National and International Contests in many fields and the number of students involved in European and International projects.</p><p>     In the last three years, I have been Anne-Marie Heim Informatics teacher. Consequently, I deem that this recommendation will be noteworthy and complete, as we developed a fruitful collaboration throughout our classes.</p><p>     From the beginning, Anne-Marie amazed me by her ambitious character and by her determination for solving a requested problem. Never did she underestimate the importance of an exercise, considering each of it a new challenge, as she always sought for the best solution. Moreover, Anne is an inquisitive student, ardent for knowledge quickly inheriting new concepts or phenomena. In this context, she is not afraid to encounter situations never met before; thus, she enjoys tackling with severe problems and experimenting newly learnt methods to better mastering them. In other words, she demonstrates her desire for intellectual nourishment and personal development in my every class.</p><p>    Furthermore, I can assert that Anne-Marie is a hard-working person with a perseverance character that has always managed to work calmly under pressure, bearing and foreseeing the possible impediments to achieving her goal set. By combining a wide-range of knowledge, she copes with handling any situation; making her a flexible student with whom is easy to work. During classes, I could not ignore Anne-Marie’s social character, as she has never hesitated into offering counselling to her classmates. It is obvious, in my opinion, that Anne-Marie’s solicitous style was a prominent element that helped her bond with her colleagues. Her teamwork skills offer her the capacity to adapt to any environment and to collaborate for the best outcome. My student’s flair for organisation and take-charge personality allows her to be fearful of taking new responsibilities being able to engage in a wide-range of activities.</p><p>    However, Anne-Marie also manifested a vivid interest for web designing but mostly for cybersecurity; her extra-curricular activities improved her learning skills and enriched her with vital knowledge. I was amazed by her willingness to go beyond what is required, as she trained continuously and extensively throughout high school in order to enhance different skills. She took Java, SQL and database courses at Oracle, online courses at CodeAcademy in HTML, CSS, and Python and another course on HourOfCode, KhanAcademy and FutureLearn. Noteworthy is her desire to obtain the CISCO Essentials certificate and to complete two self-study courses: “Cyber Essentials” and “Intro to Cybersecurity”.</p><p>    I deem that Anne-Marie will be an asset for your university, representing a significant contribution to the academic community, by her personality diversity and her intellectual power. I predict that my student will pass the Baccalaureate Exam with grades above 9.50 in Mathematics, Biology and Romanian Language and Literature.</p><p>     I hope this recommendation will be a great help in outlining Anne-Marie’s conspicuous desire for intellectual development, as I have tried to present her commitment to enriching her science studies and her struggling in achieving the settled quest. If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.</p><p> </p><p>Yours sincerely,        </p><p>   Cristina Olaru           </p><p>                 </p><p>Teacher of Computer Science</p><p>Mobile: +40 765 722 855</p><p>E-mail:  cristina.olaru@profinfo.edu.ro</p><p>“Tudor Vianu” National High School of Computer Science</p><p>Address:    10, Arhitect Ion Mincu St., Sector 1</p><p>Bucharest, 011358, Romania</p><p>                                                 </p>
