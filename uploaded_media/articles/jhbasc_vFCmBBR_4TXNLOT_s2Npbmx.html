<p>Every job today relies on a solid informational infrastructure in one way or another. This infrastructure not only eases people's tasks but also increases companies’ margins by optimizing workflows and provides entertainment on demand for free time activities. I want to be part of the people who help run the things that create so much value for everyone. And I believe the (•insert course name•) could help me in this endeavour. </p><p>I am Tudor-Alin Croitoru, I studied at “Tudor Vianu” National College of Informatics and for the last four years I’ve been passionate about computers. The high school programme I followed had 4 classes per week of computer science in the first 2 years and then it increased to 7 classes per week. Each year except for the last one was 37 weeks long, with 32 for the 12th grade. This all adds up to 779 hours of studying computer science. While I can’t claim that this number reflects my abilities in programming, I can wholeheartedly say that being in front of computers for so long in an environment where there was almost always an issue to be fixed, I learned a great deal about supporting end-users and network design.</p><p>Then, in my own time I enjoy creating and solving problems, usually related to computers. This generally entails a thorough study of the documentation or manual pages. However, I must mention that my favourite approach to learning is through first hand experience. Obviously, though, to best understand the details and nuances of what I learn, I never skimp on reading the necessary documentation. Sometimes I check the manual one last time before finally launching the command into execution, just to be sure.</p><p>As for hobbies, although playing video games is not among my favourite activities, playing with computers does take up most of my time. It’s both a professional interest and a hobby. But aside from trying out Linux distributions and running various servers on them, my leisure activities include composing, playing guitar, mixing and mastering songs and going sightseeing on my longboard. In the summer of 2017 I worked in a production studio where my main responsibilities were editing sound samples and packaging them for sale and, of course, fixing whatever issues may have risen with the digital equipment there. Yet, I do feel the best thing there was the training I got from the sound engineer. This is one example of an area where self-study simply can’t beat practice and apprenticeship, in my opinion; it was one the best experiences I’ve had developing my knowledge and abilities.</p><p>When it comes to friends, the people I try to surround myself with are usually the ones from whom I have the most to learn. I have this belief that every person met and every conversation had contribute to the development of an individual in ways that might seem minute at first, but always prove themselves to be significant sooner or later. And as with anything, the more positive the input is, the more positive the output becomes. So naturally, I gravitate towards the people with whom I can have substantial conversations from which both of us can derive as great a value as possible.</p><p>Finally, the reasons why Denmark felt like the best option, apart from education, are the viking by heritage and the concept of the Janteloven. I’ve always been fascinated about vikings so visiting their homeland would be an accomplishment in itself, let alone living there! But more than that, I want to see and be part of a culture where mutual help, respect and the general feeling of unity are the norm. I know that all the nordic countries have in their popular conscience the laws of Jante but I feel the Danish people understood it best as “hygge” complements this concept. </p>
