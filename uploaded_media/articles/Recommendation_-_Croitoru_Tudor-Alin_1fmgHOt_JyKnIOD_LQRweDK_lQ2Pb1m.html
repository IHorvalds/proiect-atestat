<p>Letter of Recommendation</p><p>      </p><p>My name is Cristina Olaru, and I am a first-degree teacher at “Tudor Vianu” National High School of Computer Science. The curriculum of our high school focuses on Computer Science, Mathematics and Sciences. The advanced rank of our institution it is justified by a large number of prizes won by our students in National and International Contests in many fields and the number of students involved in European and International projects.</p><p>In the last three years, I have been Tudor-Alin Croitoru’s Informatics teacher. Consequently, I deem that this recommendation will be noteworthy and complete, as we developed a fruitful collaboration throughout our classes.</p><p>From the beginning, Tudor amazed me with his ambitious character and with his determination for solving a requested problem. Never did he underestimate the importance of an exercise, considering each of them a new challenge, as he always sought for the best solution. Moreover, Tudor is an inquisitive student, ardent for knowledge, quickly inheriting new concepts or phenomena. In this context, he is not afraid to encounter situations never met before; thus, he enjoys tackling with severe problems and experimenting newly learnt methods to better master them. In other words, he demonstrates his desire for intellectual nourishment and personal development in my every class.</p><p>Furthermore, I can assert that Tudor is a hard-working person with a perseverant character that has always managed to work calmly under pressure, bearing and foreseeing the possible impediments to achieving his goal set. By combining a wide-range of knowledge, he copes with any situation; making him a flexible student with whom it’s easy to work. During classes, I could not ignore Tudor’s social character, as he has never hesitated into offering counselling to his classmates. It is obvious, in my opinion, that Tudor’s solicitous style was a prominent element that helped his bond with his colleagues. His teamwork skills offer him the capacity to adapt to any environment and to collaborate for the best outcome. My student’s flair for organisation and take-charge personality allows him to be fearfless in taking new responsibilities, being able to engage in a wide-range of activities.</p><p>However, Tudor also manifested a vivid interest for web designing but mostly for networking and system administration with a keen interest in Linux; his extra-curricular activities improved his learning skills and enriched him with vital knowledge. I was amazed by his willingness to go beyond what is required, as he trained continuously and extensively throughout high school in order to enhance different skills. He took Java, SQL and database courses at Oracle and online courses at CodeAcademy in JavaScript.</p><p>I deem that Tudor will be an asset for your university, representing a significant contribution to the academic community, by his personality diversity and his intellectual power. I predict that my student will pass the Baccalaureate Exam with grades above 9 in Mathematics, Physics and Romanian Language and Literature.</p><p>I hope this recommendation will be a great help in outlining Tudor’s conspicuous desire for intellectual development, as I have tried to present his commitment to enriching his science studies and his struggling in achieving the settled quest. If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.</p><p> </p><p>Yours sincerely,        </p><p> Cristina Olaru           </p><p>                 </p><p>Teacher of Computer Science</p><p>Mobile: +40 765 722 855</p><p>E-mail:  cristina.olaru@profinfo.edu.ro</p><p>“Tudor Vianu” National High School of Computer Science</p><p>Address:    10, Arhitect Ion Mincu St., Sector 1</p><p>Bucharest, 011358, Romania</p><p>                                                 </p>
