<p>Letter of Recommendation </p><p>My name is Cristina-Maria Olaru and I am a Computer Science teacher at the Tudor Vianu National College of Bucharest, Romania. Our school is one of the oldest and most selective schools, which enjoys a very good reputation due to its students who won many national and international competitions in physics, mathematics, computer sciences and chemistry. Last year, students were required to score a minimum of 9.56 out of 10 in the National Exams to enter our high school cycle.  </p><p>I have been Pene Cosmin-Octavianâ€™s teacher for 3 years and I can affirm that he is one of the most outstanding students I have met in my career. Based on his excellent academic results, Cosmin has been admitted into one of the top classes in our high-school, which is recognized as having one of the most competitive Computer Science programmes in the country.</p><p>Having observed him closely, I have noted the progress he has made throughout high school. He shows great skills in teamwork, being able to easily integrate in a new environment by making himself liked and accepted as a leader. He does a great job at pushing the limits of a team and has displayed well-developed people skills. Furthermore, Cosmin is a very determined person with a strong will who is fulfilling his duties and assignments within the deadlines at all times. He has also shown commitment and a desire for self-improvement and, as a result, he delivers his absolute best whenever he takes on a project.  </p><p>He has proven himself as an intelligent and well-rounded student, with excellent results in all subjects, which placed him among the top three students of his class. He is a remarkably fast learner, which made it easy for him to grasp even the most difficult concepts I taught in my Computer Science class, as well as in Mathematics and Physics. In fact, he has participated in several Informatics, ICT and Mathematics Olympiads, as well as local and national programming and robotics competitions. Most notably, he earned 6<sup>th</sup> place in the national ITFest Algorithmic Programming Competition, where he displayed exemplary teamwork and time-management skills. Further worth mentioning are his participation in the Empowersoft Programming Contest and the Linux Embedded Robotics Challenge, where along with a teammate he had to design and build a robot from scratch, using a 3D printer to create the individual components. </p><p>Aside from his academic achievements, I was further impressed with his ambition and dedication in his endeavours outside of school, with an outstanding commitment to improving his skills in programming and IT. He has trained extensively throughout high school, taking courses in Java Programming at Oracle, online courses at CodeAcademy in CSS, Python, Ruby, SQL and several others, as well as obtaining the CISCO Essentials and ECDL Standard certificates. Furthermore, I am very proud of him for successfully completing the C Piscine Testing at Academy+Plus, a highly competitive IT school, following which he will take an internship in Software Development this autumn. </p><p><a id="_gjdgxs"></a>Based on my experience as his teacher, I am sure Cosmin will respond positively to all the challenges of an international university and I believe he will become a top professional in his field. Therefore, I wholeheartedly recommend Pene Cosmin-Octavian for your Computer Science Programme, where he will have the opportunity to develop his knowledge and skills in a competitive and diverse learning environment.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Name: Cristina-Maria Olaru</p><p>Email: criola222@yahoo.com</p><p>Phone: +40 765 722 855</p><p> </p>
