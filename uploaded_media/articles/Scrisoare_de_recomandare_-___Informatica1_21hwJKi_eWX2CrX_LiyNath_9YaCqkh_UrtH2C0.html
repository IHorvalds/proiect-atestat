<p>Letter of Recommendation </p><p>My name is Cristina-Maria Olaru and I am a Computer Science teacher at the Tudor Vianu National College of Bucharest, Romania. Our school is one of the oldest and most selective schools, which enjoys a very good reputation due to its students who won many national and international competitions in physics, mathematics, computer sciences and chemistry. Last year, students were required to score a minimum of 9.56 out of 10 in the National Exams to enter our high school cycle.  </p><p>I have been Tudor-Alin Croitoruâ€™s teacher for 3 years and I can affirm that he is one of the most outstanding students I have met in my career. Based on his excellent academic results, Tudor has been admitted into one of the top classes in our high-school, which is recognized as having one of the most competitive Computer Science programmes in the country.</p><p>Having observed him closely, I have noted the progress he has made throughout high school. He shows great skills in teamwork, being able to easily integrate in a new environment by making himself liked and accepted as a leader. He does a great job at pushing the limits of a team and has displayed well-developed people skills. Furthermore, Tudor is a very determined person with a strong will who is fulfilling his duties and assignments within the deadlines at all times. He has also shown commitment and a desire for self-improvement and, as a result, he delivers his absolute best whenever he takes on a project.  </p><p>He has proven himself as an intelligent and well-rounded student. He is a remarkably fast learner, which made it easy for him to grasp even the most difficult concepts I taught in my Computer Science class, as well as in Mathematics. Furthermore, last year in May he participated in the National phase of the English olympiad, ranking very well among the best in the country.</p><p>Aside from his academic achievements, I was further impressed with his ambition and dedication in his endeavours outside of school, with an outstanding commitment to improving his skills in programming and IT. He has trained extensively throughout high school, taking courses in Java Programming at Oracle, online courses at CodeCademy in JavaScript, as well as developing a web application in the promising new programming language Dart. </p><p><a id="_gjdgxs"></a>Based on my experience as his teacher, I am sure Tudor will respond positively to all the challenges of an international university and I believe he will become a top professional in his field. Therefore, I wholeheartedly recommend Tudor-Alin Croitoru for your It and Technology programme, where he will have the opportunity to develop his knowledge and skills in a competitive and diverse learning environment.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Name: Cristina-Maria Olaru</p><p>Email: criola222@yahoo.com</p><p>Phone: +40 765 722 855</p><p> </p>
